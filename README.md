	- my background
    - hornist | improviser
    - public librarian
  - "feminist technologist"
    - critical of tools for creation and dissemination
      - gender: beautiful, complex, socially constructed
        - our society allows some folks more agency over themselves than other folks based on their gender
      - does the tool resist or reinforce systems of oppression?
      - does it help to reimagine a world without misogynistic | racist | ableist oppression?
