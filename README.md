	- background
    - hornist | improviser
    - public librarian
			- agency & open access

  - "feminist technologist"
    - critical of tools for creation and dissemination
      - gender: beautiful, complex, socially constructed
        - our society allows some folks more agency over themselves than other folks based on their gender
      - does the tool help resist or reinforce systems of oppression?
      - does it help to reimagine a world without misogynistic | racist | ableist oppression?

  - teaching life at berklee
    - representation
    - "pop" music?
			- critical awareness of capitalist oppression

## amplifying listener agency
	- the "overcome, vulnerable" listener?
	- explicitly acknowleging the individual subjectivity of the listener

## works I've thought most about

- **[The Glass Concert (1967-1970)/ Annea Lockwood](http://www.annealockwood.com/compositions/)**

- **[Funk Lessons (1983)/ Adrian Piper](http://www.adrianpiper.com/vs/video_fl.shtml)**

## immersive audio and agency
	- horn & immersion
	- binaural, object-based: tools to help me explicity acknowlege individual subjectivity of the listener?
	- against the studio wizard paradigm
